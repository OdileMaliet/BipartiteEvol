# BipartiteEvol

This repository contains the code used to run the BipartiteEvol model. 

The file "Example_bipartite.R" contains an example of how to run the model, using the functions available in "main.R".

Note : the fitness fonction "fitness.c" needs compilation before the model can run on your computer. This can be achieved using the command R CMD SHLIB fitness.c
